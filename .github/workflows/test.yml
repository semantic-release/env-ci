+
+This is a GitHub API resource built with [nanoc][nanoc].
+
+All submissions are welcome. To submit a change, fork this repo, commit your changes, and send us a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
+
+## Setup
+
+Ruby 1.9 is required to build the site.
+
+Get the nanoc gem, plus kramdown for Markdown parsing:
+
+```sh
+$ bundle install
+```
+
+You can see the available commands with nanoc:
+
+```sh
+$ bundle exec nanoc -h
+```
+
+Nanoc has [some nice documentation](http://nanoc.ws/docs/tutorial/) to get you started.  Though if you're mainly concerned with editing or adding content, you won't need to know much about nanoc.
+
+[nanoc]: http://nanoc.ws/
+
+## Styleguide
+
+Not sure how to structure the docs?  Here's what the structure of the
+API docs should look like:
+
+    # API title
+
+    * TOC
+    {:toc}
+
+    ## API endpoint title
+
+        [VERB] /path/to/endpoint
+
+    ### Parameters
+
+    Name | Type | Description
+    -----|------|--------------
+    `name`|`type` | Description.
+
+    ### Input (request JSON body)
+
+    Name | Type | Description
+    -----|------|--------------
+    `name`|`type` | Description.
+
+    ### Response
+
+    <%= headers 200, :pagination => default_pagination_rels, 'X-Custom-Header' => "value" %>
+    <%= json :resource_name %>
+
+**Note**: We're using [Kramdown Markdown extensions](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html), such as definition lists.
+
+### JSON Responses
+
+We specify the JSON responses in Ruby so that we don't have to write
+them by hand all over the docs.  You can render the JSON for a resource
+like this:
+
+```erb
+<%= json :issue %>
+```
+
+This looks up `GitHub::Resources::ISSUE` in `lib/resources.rb`.
+
+Some actions return arrays.  You can modify the JSON by passing a block:
+
+```erb
+<%= json(:issue) { |hash| [hash] } %>
+```
+
+### Terminal blocks
+
+You can specify terminal blocks with `pre.terminal` elements.  (It'd be nice if
+Markdown could do this more cleanly.)
+
+```html
+<pre class="terminal">
+$ curl foobar
+....
+</pre>
+```
+
+This is not a `curl` tutorial though. Not every API call needs
+to show how to access it with `curl`.
+
+## Development
+
+Nanoc compiles the site into static files living in `./output`.  It's
+smart enough not to try to compile unchanged files:
+
+```sh
+$ bundle exec nanoc compile
+Loading site data...
+Compiling site...
+   identical  [0.00s]  output/css/960.css
+   identical  [0.00s]  output/css/pygments.css
+   identical  [0.00s]  output/css/reset.css
+   identical  [0.00s]  output/css/styles.css
+   identical  [0.00s]  output/css/uv_active4d.css
+      update  [0.28s]  output/index.html
+      update  [1.31s]  output/v3/gists/comments/index.html
+      update  [1.92s]  output/v3/gists/index.html
+      update  [0.25s]  output/v3/issues/comments/index.html
+      update  [0.99s]  output/v3/issues/labels/index.html
+      update  [0.49s]  output/v3/issues/milestones/index.html
+      update  [0.50s]  output/v3/issues/index.html
+      update  [0.05s]  output/v3/index.html
+Site compiled in 5.81s.
+```
+
+You can setup whatever you want to view the files. If using the adsf
+gem (as listed in the Gemfile), you can start Webrick:
+
+```sh
+$ bundle exec nanoc view
+$ open http://localhost:3000
+```
+
+Compilation times got you down?  Use `autocompile`!
+
+```sh
+$ bundle exec nanoc autocompile
+```
+
+This starts a web server too, so there's no need to run `nanoc view`.
+One thing: remember to add trailing slashes to all nanoc links!
+
+## Deploy
+
+```sh
+$ bundle exec rake publish
+```

# SQLDelight

See the [project website](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/) for documentation and APIs

SQLDelight generates typesafe Kotlin APIs from your SQL statements. It verifies your schema, statements, and migrations at compile-time and provides IDE features like autocomplete and refactoring which make writing and maintaining SQL simple.

SQLDelight understands your existing SQL schema.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hockey_player (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  number INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

It generates typesafe code for any labeled SQL statements.

![intro.gif](docs/images/intro.gif)

---

SQLDelight supports a variety of dialects and platforms:

SQLite

* [Android](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/android_sqlite)
* [Native (iOS, macOS, or Windows)](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/native_sqlite)
* [JVM](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/jvm_sqlite)
* [Javascript](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/js_sqlite)
* [Multiplatform](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/multiplatform_sqlite)

[MySQL (JVM)](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/jvm_mysql/)

[PostgreSQL (JVM)](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/jvm_postgresql) (Experimental)

[HSQL/H2 (JVM)](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/jvm_h2) (Experimental)

## Snapshots
